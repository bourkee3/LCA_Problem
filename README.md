Task 1: Binary Tree Lowest Common Ancestor Problem

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree is the lowest node that has both v and w as descendants
My Tests
1.	Test for an empty tree
2.	Test a null tree case
3.	Test the constructor
4.	Test one node tree
5.	Test two node tree 
6.	Check for the Lowest Common Ancestor
7.	Test for non-existing nodes in tree

Task 2: Lowest Common Ancestor in a Directed Acyclic Graph

The directed acyclic graph will have nodes pointing to one another like the binary tree in task 1 except they will be joining other nodes from different branches at an early or later stage. Not all nodes have edges or connections leading into them or out of them.
